# üè† Local + Public Access Alternative

## If You Want to Avoid Cloud Databases Entirely:

### Option 1: Use SQLite (Simplest)
Convert your app to use SQLite (file-based database):

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Works on Vercel
- ‚úÖ Zero cost
- ‚úÖ Good for small to medium apps

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Single file (no concurrent writes)
- ‚ùå Limited for large scale

### Option 2: Local MySQL + Ngrok (Development)
Keep your local MySQL and expose it:

**Steps:**
1. Install ngrok: `npm install -g ngrok`
2. Expose MySQL: `ngrok tcp 3306`
3. Use ngrok URL in production

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Keep existing setup
- ‚úÖ No cloud account needed

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Computer must stay on
- ‚ùå Not reliable for production

### Option 3: Free XAMPP Hosting
Some services offer free XAMPP hosting with MySQL:

1. **000webhost** (free with ads)
2. **InfinityFree** (free tier)
3. **FreeHosting.com** (limited)

## üéØ Recommendation:
**For your placement system**, I still recommend **Railway** as it's:
- Actually free (for now)
- Reliable
- Easy to set up
- MySQL compatible

Would you like me to help you set up Railway, or would you prefer to try the SQLite conversion?
